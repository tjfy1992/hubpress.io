## Before Started
With Vue became more and more popular as a javascript framework in the recent years, a large amount of companies have chosen it as a main part of their website development plan. As a lightweight framework, Vue is easy to learn and use, which makes it simpler than ever to build a website. In addition, many UI libraries based on VUE are open-source and available with detailed documents. The one that we introduce today would be ElementUI, which is one of the open-source UI libraries presented by ELE.ME, a food ordering and delivery O2O platform. Here are the official websites for VUE and ElementUI: https://vuejs.org/[Vuejs] and http://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/installation/[ElementUI].

Here are something that we need to build a website:

 - NodeJS(npm)
 - Webstorm (IDE for Vue)
 - Nginx(proxy server)
 - Eclipse(IDE for java)
 - Windows 10(or whatever OS you prefer for development)

### Installation of nodeJS and npm

As we need to use tha package manager 'npm', we need to install nodeJS. In fact, npm is a module of nodeJS, and has already been integrated into the nodeJS installer. We can visit https://nodejs.org/en/[Offcial Site of NodeJS] and download the newest version for our OS. Here I download teh zip file for win64, and unzip it after downloading, and then we can see a node.exe in the directory.

One more step for Windows user to do is to add the current directory's path into the 'Path' of System Environment Variables. And then we open the 'cmd', and input npm -v. If you see the output like below, then nodeJS is succesfully installed and configured in your computer.

And from now on we could use npm in any directory and path.

### Install Webstorm
Webstorm is an excellent IDE for Front-end development. In the newest version of Webstorm Vue is supported by default and syntax highlighting. We can visit http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[Webstorm's offical web] to download the IDE.

After we enter Webstorm, there is one more thing we need to do before starting to write code. We need to add the template of VUE to the template library so that we don't need to write some default code every time when we create a vue component. At the lefttop of the IDE, we click FILE->New->Edit File Templates, and click the green 'plus' icon on the rightop, and input the Name and Extension for the template:

And then add the following code into the code area below

```
<template>
    <div>
    </div>
</template>
<script type="text/ecmascript-6">
    export default {
        data(){
            return {
                
            }
        }
    }
</script>

```

Then click apply, and click ok. Now we click the File->New on the lefttop again, and we can see the Vue Component that we created just now. We choose it, and input 'test' for its name, then we can see the code in the new file, just as we wrote before.

You may notice that the component is written with Javascript ES6, but the IDE supports ES5 by default. So we need to click File->Settings, and change the settings like following:

Then click apply, and click OK.

### Create a project of ElementUI
ES5 is still the majority these days, and not all the browser support ES6. We need babel to translate the ES6 back into ES5, and package the files using webpack. Sounds complicated, right? Don't worry, we don't need to configure these tools by ourself. If we are buliding an ordinary vue project, we could use vue-cli which automatically generates what we need for us. But right now we are creating an ElementUI project based on Vue, things become really simple. There is a general project template at https://github.com/ElementUI/element-starter[ElementUI team's Github]. We download the template, unzip it, done.
The stucture of the project is like following:

image::http://img.blog.csdn.net/20170526112758965?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQvdTAxMjkwNzA0OQ==/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast[]

All the tools are already in it. Now we install npm modules into the directory. In the 'cmd', we enter the current directory, and input

```
npm install
```

After the installation we can see that there is a new directory called node_modules in our project. That is where the dependency packages are. If we want to add a new dependency in the future, we run the code above again followed by the package that we want to install, followed by --save. For example, if we want to add vue-router, then input 

```
npm install vue-router --save
```
npm will automatically find the newest version of the package and install it.


### Make it run

After installation of the dependencies, we need to package the project and make it run. We input the following:

```
npm run dev
```

This means run the project with the localhost. We can see the configuration information in webpack.config.js:

```
devServer: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 8010,
    proxy: {
      '/api/': {
        target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080',
        changeOrigin: true,
        pathRewrite: {
          '^/api': ''
        }
      }
    },
```

As we see, the default port of localhost is 8010. If you want to change the port, just change it here.

After we input 'npm run dev', we wait for a while until it shows webpack: Compiled successfully. Then we open the browser and visit localhost:8010, if you see the page shown below, then congrats, you have successfully build a small website with VUE and ElementUI!

Click the 'Let's do it' button, we can see a message floating on the top right. That is one of the components provided by ElementUI.

As it shows, it's time to bulid something epic!

In the next post I will introduce some details to write a navigation page and something about vue-router.
